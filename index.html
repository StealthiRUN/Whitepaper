      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Stealth $RUN, the revolutionary crypto project designed to reward holders and foster growth within the Koinos Ecosystem. With a capped supply of 10,000,000 tokens and zero transaction tax, Stealth $RUN offers a unique and compelling opportunity for real estate and crypto enthusiasts.</p>

      <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
      <p><b>Max Supply: 10,000,000 $RUN</b></p>
            <p>• 50% Liquidity (5,000,000 $RUN): To ensure robust liquidity and stability.</p> 
            <p>• 30% Staking Rewards (3,000,000 $RUN): Rewarding our community is at the heart of Stealth $RUN.</p>
            <p>• 20% Team (2,000,000 $RUN): Initially added as liquidity during launch, and later used for marketing, strategic liquidity additions, and supporting Milestone achievements.</p>

      <p><b>Liquidity Pools</b></p>
      <p>Our initial liquidity pools are paired with leading tokens in the Koinos Ecosystem, chosen for their utility and growth potential. The strategic pairings strengthen $RUN's liquidity while also promoting the growth of other projects within the ecosystem. This low liquidity, high expected growth approach positions Stealth $RUN as a catalyst for broader ecosystem development.</p>
      <p>Initial pairs launched with (1000) Koinos split in equal parts between: <b>Koinos (200), Liquidity UP (200), Koin Crew Token (200), Bitkoin (200), D.A.R.E (200)</b></p>
      <p>Team liquidity pairs launched with (425) Koinos split between: <b>Koinos (200), Frenchie (100), MK (100), Shit (25).</b>

      <p><b>Staking Pools</b></p>
        <p>Stealth $RUN is designed to be self-sustaining and highly rewarding for holders. At inception, we launched seven staking pools:</p>
          <p>• Five pools to distribute ALL initial LP tokens created for each pool, each running for 3 years.</p>
          <p>• One pool to launch the initial 10% supply staking rewards over the first 30 days.</p>
          <p>• One pool to slowly distribute the final 20% supply through $KOIN/$RUN liquidity staking over 12 years.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>As the value of $RUN increases, so do the rewards for stakers. Individuals can purchase $RUN tokens and stake them on Koincity to earn a share of the Liquidity Provider tokens created at launch. This provides a creative approach to decentralizing the liquidity of Stealth $RUN.</p>

      <h2>Plans and Milestones</h2>
          <p>Stealth $RUN is not just a token; it's a vision for the future. $RUN tokens will act as credits that can be used within our ecosystem on Koinos. Through NFTs, we will offer secure opportunies to aquire tokens and participate in our real estate investments. </p>

           <p>• <b>Milestone 4:</b> Continue to launch new collections and grow a portfolio of rental properties.</p>

      <p><b>Real Estate Strategy</b></p>
        <p>Rental property investments should follow a five-year buy-to-sell plan, accounting for ongoing expenses such as property taxes, home insurance, and utilities. When a property is sold, funds will be disbursed to the designated property's NFT collection. By purchasing homes outright, we eliminate mortgage-related costs, ensuring that our assets are held with less ongoing expense risk.</p> 
<p>Units will be rented out and token holders can book accommodations in any of our owned properties using $RUN tokens. Holders will have priority to book a stay, before units are made available to the public. All rental incomes will be retained to cover fixed and variable expenses for the unit. $RUN tokens collected will be retained, burned, airdropped, or added to liquidity. </p>
