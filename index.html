      <h2>Tokenomics</h2>
      <p><b>Max Supply: 10,000,000 $RUN</b></p>
            <p>• 50% Liquidity (5,000,000 $RUN): To ensure robust liquidity and stability.</p> 
            <p>• 30% Staking Rewards (3,000,000 $RUN): Rewarding our community is at the heart of Stealth $RUN.</p>

      <p><b>Liquidity Pools</b></p>
      <p>Our initial liquidity pools are paired with leading tokens in the Koinos Ecosystem, chosen for their utility and growth potential. The strategic pairings strengthens $RUN's liquidity while also promoting the growth of other projects within the ecosystem. This low liquidity, high expected growth approach positions Stealth $RUN as a catalyst for broader ecosystem development.</p>
      <p>Initial pairs launched with (1000) Koinos split in equal parts between: <b>Koinos (200), Liquidity UP (200), Koin Crew Token (200), Bitkoin (200), D.A.R.E (200)</b></p>
      <p>Team liquidity pairs launched with (425) Koinos split between: <b>Koinos (200), Frenchie (100), MK (100), Shit (25).</b>

      <p><b>Staking Pools</b></p>
        <p>Stealth $RUN is designed to be self-sustaining and highly rewarding for holders. At inception, we launched seven staking pools:</p>
          <p>• Five pools to distribute ALL inital LP tokens created for each pool, each running for 3 years.</p>
          <p>• One pool to launch the initial 10% supply staking rewards over the first 30 days.</p>
          <p>• One pool to slowly distribute the final 20% supply through $KOIN/$RUN liquidity staking over 12 years.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>As the value of $RUN increases, so do the rewards for stakers. Indiviuals can purchase $RUN tokens then stake them on Koincity to earn a share of the Liquidity Provider tokens created at launch. This provides a creative appraoch to decentralizing the lqiuidity of Stealth $RUN.</p>

      <h2>Plans and Milestones</h2>
          <p>Stealth $RUN is not just a token; it's a vision for the future. As we reach key market cap milestones, we will strategically sell portions of our accumulated supply to fund ambitious projects and initiatives. These sell orders will take place in very concentrated areas allowing a large amount of new buyers to enter the market without agressive volatility.</p>
            <p>• <b>Milestone 1:</b> Breach $1,500,000 Market Cap</p>
              <p>- Action: Sell 10% Supply</p>
              <p>- Value Extracted: >$150,000</p>
              <p>- Project: Build a Single Family Home, rent this out on a long term agreement</p>

              <p>- Value Extracted: >$1,000,000</p>
              <p>- Project: Buy a Luxurious Vacation Home or multiple vacation homes. These should be rented on short term agreements, similar to air bnb</p>

              <p>- Action: Sell 10% Supply</p>

           <p>• <b>Milestone 4:</b> Breach $1,000,000,000 Market Cap</p>
              <p>- Action: Sell 10-20% Supply</p>

              <p>- Project: Provide Free Housing, Food, Water, and Medical Aid Worldwide.</p>

      <p><b>Real Estate Strategy</b></p>
        <p>All real estate investments will follow a five-year buy-to-sell plan, accounting for ongoing expenses such as property taxes, home insurance, and utilities. When a property is sold, we will look to buy another home to replace it. By purchasing properties outright with cash, we eliminate mortgage-related costs, ensuring that our assets are fully owned and available for Stealth $RUN holders and partners.</p> 
<p>Units will be rented out and holders can book accomodations in any of our owned properties using $RUN tokens. Holders will have priority to book before units are made available to the public. All rental incomes received will be distributed back to token holders and partners through: $RUN token buy backs, liqudiity adds, staking rewards and airdrops. </p>
